## Overview

GenAI is a framework aimed at harnessing the capabilities of generative AI to create more intelligent, responsive, and context-aware applications. This repository includes implementations, experiments, and tools for working with AgenticAI and AgenticChunk.

## Features

- **AgenticAI**: A sophisticated AI model designed to exhibit agent-like behaviors and decision-making capabilities.
- **AgenticChunk**: A modular component system that allows for the easy manipulation and combination of AI-generated outputs.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Built with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to add their own models and features.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for both researchers and developers, with clear documentation and examples.

## Installation

To get started with GenAI, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start experimenting with the models. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use AgenticAI:

```python

```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [documentation](docs/).

## Components

### AgenticAI

AgenticAI is designed to act as an intelligent agent capable of understanding context and making decisions based on input. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques in natural language processing and reinforcement learning.

- **Key Features**:
  - Contextual understanding
  - Decision-making capabilities
  - Support for multiple input formats

### AgenticChunk

AgenticChunk provides a modular framework to work with generative outputs. It allows users to create, manipulate, and combine chunks of information generated by AgenticAI or other models.

- **Key Features**:
  - Modular design for flexibility
  - Easy integration with various data sources
  - Supports serialization and deserialization of chunks
